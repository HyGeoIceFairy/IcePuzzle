# Ice Puzzle
## 1. Introduction
Hi! This is Ice Puzzle made by Hypergeometry Ice Fairy. I am new to puzzlehunt making so the quality of the puzzles might not be good. Apologize for that! Anyway, please enjoy!
## 2. Puzzle
- You can see the ```puzzle``` folder for puzzles. There are five parts. The normal parts each contain five normal puzzles and one meta puzzle. There is also a final meta, where you need all the parts before.
- However, the puzzles will be released some in one day or two, so you need to wait for some time. You might need some Touhou knowledge for some puzzles.
## 3. Hint
You can add the QQ ```3898357231``` and ask Patchouli for Knowledge.
## 4. Launch & Check
You should run ```launcher.exe``` each time you want to try the puzzles to get the latest puzzles. Pay more attention to the update announcements since they might contain important information. After checking update, the checker will start and you can check whether your answer is correct there. However, to check the final meta, you should send your answer to the QQ above. If you successfully solve final meta, you can contact Patchouli at an offline THO event to choose a badge of your choice from our circle, Hexagonal Crescent (QQ group: 786650214). Remember the answers are all words in LOWERCASE!!!
## 5. Tips
- It is recommended to use a text editor that can see Markdown.
- Think twice before ask for hints.
- The final meta is not judged automatically, so you might wait for a while.
- If you are stuck, doing something else then back to the puzzle later might be helpful.
